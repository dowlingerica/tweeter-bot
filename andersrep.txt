Probably, but why would I want to?
I do my best!
Nice view.
Good to know!
(Chuckles) I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself.
You must have some desires...
Thank you.
I owe you one!
You... have a fair point.
Why?
That's not strictly accurate.
Many people are.
No, it wasn't.
About what?
You... believe that?
You're probably right.
Shut up.
So help me...
What's it to you?
That's it!
That can't be true.
That was almost profound.
Yes.
Why would you do that?
Andraste's Knickerweasels!
I was.
Hilarious!
Is there a down side?
I'm charming.
I'm a Mage, not a miracle worker.
Oh no! Not you too!
Need a hand?
Victory!
Eww.
That's the point.
You do?
You're not helping.
What are we talking about?
And your point is?
Some things are certain.
That's.... that's great.
There's plenty to say.
Beg your pardon?
Yes, I suppose I am.
What?
What are you talking about?
You're kidding.
Are you sure you want to encourage me? I might be about to confess my undying love.
Don't.
[Justice voice] Stop.
Good point.
Nothing.
Excuse me?
Fair point.
... You might be on to something there.
Really?
That's only partly true.
Thank you. I will think on what you've said.
That's not usually the response I get.
Goodbye.
I love you.
I'm sorry.
What, what?
...Wait!
Trash.
Fifty silvers.
Good riddance.
You make it sound like so much fun.
Dirty spells?
I don't think I want to know.
Believe me, I do.
Oh, yes ser, please ser.
It's got... potential.
Any suggestions?
